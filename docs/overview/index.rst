- **Conductor**: A service for processing and managing datasets, and automatically training your models on your own data.

- **Conductor Dashboard**: See how GPT-4o, Claude Opus, or your custom models are performing on your datasets and open benchmarks.

- **Data Augmentation**: Build invariance to different environments by augmenting your dataset with Mbodi's diffusion-based data augmentation to achieve better generalization.

- **Mbodied SVLM**: A new Spatial Vision Language Model trained specifically for spatial reasoning and robotics control.

Idea
^^^^^^

The core idea behind Mbodied Agents is end-to-end continual learning. We believe that the best way to train a robot is to have it learn from its own experiences.
